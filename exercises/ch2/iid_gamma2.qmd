## Solution 
The likelihood function from a sample $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ is

$$
p(x_1,\ldots,x_n \vert \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n\theta^2 x_i \exp (-x_i\theta) \propto \theta^{2n}\exp\Big(-\theta \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \Big)
$$

This likelihood resembles a Gamma distribution, so a good guess for a conjugate prior would be the $\theta \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\alpha,\beta)$ distribution; to see that this is indeed a reasonable guess, note that the particular form of the Gamma density (a power of $\theta$ times an exponential in $\theta$) makes it closed under multiplication. The posterior distribution is then

$$
\begin{align}
p(\theta|x_1,\ldots,x_n) & \propto p(x_1,\ldots,x_n \vert \theta)p(\theta) \\
      & \propto \theta^{2n}\exp\Big(-\theta \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \Big)\theta^{\alpha-1}\exp(-\theta\beta) \\
      & \propto \theta^{\alpha + 2n - 1}\exp\Big(-\theta (\beta+\sum_{i=1}^n x_i) \Big)
\end{align}
$$
and the posterior is therefore $\theta \vert x_1,\ldots,x_n \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\alpha + 2n,\beta + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i)$. Since the posterior belongs to the same (Gamma) family as the prior, the Gamma prior is indeed conjugate to this likelihood.
